the idea is to have a gateway which can do k/v storage again
a framework for handler plugins.

the initial goal is to get a gateway which speaks memcache
and does memory based k/v storage in which things being pushed
out the back are stored to disk and lookups which don't hit in
the memory pool read from the disk
